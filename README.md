## Java Chatbot - Utilizing Apache OpenNLP

Hey there! In this project, I'll be talking about a simple chatbot I developed using Java, which leverages the power of Apache OpenNLP to chat with humans. We employ several NLP techniques to understand users' messages and provide logical responses:

- **Sentence Detection:** We comprehend what the user says, sentence by sentence.
- **Tokenization:** We break down sentences into words to better grasp their meaning.
- **POS Tagging:** We identify the role of each word in a sentence (noun, verb, etc.).
- **Lemmatization:** We find the root forms of words to understand their meanings more clearly.

We pre-define responses based on certain categories and present them to the user. Everything you need to know to get the project up and running and say hello to your own chatbot is right here!

Before you start, don't forget to download model files like `categorizer.txt`, `en-sent.bin`, `en-token.bin`, `en-pos-maxent.bin`, and `en-lemmatizer.bin`. Without these files, our chatbot might be a little quiet. ;)

I've also added step-by-step instructions for easy setup and operation for everyone to try. Let's take a step into the world of NLP!

Remember, you can use the codes in your own projects, improve upon them, and join this amazing NLP journey. If you encounter any issues or just want to chat, don't hesitate to reach out. Best of luck!
